Learning how to create a new Repository.

Explanation:

Import necessary libraries: We import the required modules from scikit-learn for loading the dataset, splitting the data, creating a decision tree classifier, and evaluating the model.
Load the iris dataset: The iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification tasks.
Split the data: We split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Create a decision tree classifier: We instantiate a DecisionTreeClassifier object.
Train the classifier: We fit the classifier to the training data using the fit method.
Visualize the decision tree (optional): We can visualize the trained decision tree using the plot_tree function from sklearn.tree.
Make predictions: We use the trained classifier to make predictions on the test set using the predict method.
Evaluate the model (optional): We can evaluate the model's accuracy using the accuracy_score function from sklearn.metrics.
Remember to execute this code yourself in Google Colab to see the output.
